# AIDA Vizualization Tools

This repository contains the package `aida_viz`, a tool for visualizing "hypotheses" (from AIDA TA3) in a simple HTML format.

## Installation

We recommend setting up a virtual environment for managing dependencies by using tools such as [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) or [`virtualenv`](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/).

Install `aida_viz` by downloading this repository and running `pip install $AIDA_VIZ_REPO`, where `$AIDA_VIZ_REPO` is the top-level directory of this repository.

You will also need to manually install the Python package included in the [AIDA Interchange Format repository](https://github.com/NextCenturyCorporation/AIDA-Interchange-Format) (you do not need the Java installation).

## Usage

To generate visualizations, `aida_viz` requires a small (<1gb) SQLite database file containing the text documents found in the AIDA Phase 1 Evaluation Source Data, `LDC2019E42` (download available via the [LDC Catalog](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu)).

**The easiest way to obtain this SQLite database file is to contact the maintainers of this repository and request it from them.** However, it is possible to generate the database from the original LDC source data.

### Generating the Database

**Skip this section** if you have obtained the SQLite database file from this repository's maintainers.

Generating the database from the LDC-provided `.tgz` file is a two-step process: 

1. Convert the source data in `.tgz` format to `.zip` format. Use the script [tar_gz_to_zip.py](https://github.com/isi-vista/vistautils/blob/master/vistautils/scripts/tar_gz_to_zip.py) found in the [isi-vista/vistautils](https://github.com/isi-vista/vistautils) repository.

2. Use the resulting `.zip` file to populate the database using the following command:

	```
	python -m aida_viz.corpus -z $AIDA_SOURCE_ZIP -d $AIDA_SOURCE_SQLITE
	```

Where: 
- `$AIDA_SOURCE_ZIP` is the location of the converted `.zip` version of the source data.
- `$AIDA_SOURCE_SQLITE` is the name of the new file where the database will be written (this file should be given the `.sqlite` extension).

### Generating Visualizations

Now that you have the SQLite database file `$AIDA_SOURCE_SQLITE`, generate a visualization of an AIF `.ttl` file with the following command:

```
python -m aida_viz -a $AIDA_AIF_TTL -d $AIDA_CORPUS_SQLITE -o $RESULTS
```

Where:
- `$AIDA_AIF_TTL` is the location of the AIF `.ttl` file that you would like to visualize.
- `$RESULTS` is the **new** directory location where the results should be written.
